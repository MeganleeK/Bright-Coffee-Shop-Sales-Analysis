revenue and improve product performance. Your role, as a Junior Data Analyst, is to extract 
actionable insights from historical data and prepare a presentation to assist the CEO in 
decision-making. 
2. OBJECTIVE 
Use your analytics, SQL, and data visualization skills to help Bright Coffee Shop 
understand: 
• Which products generate the most revenue 
•  What time of day the store performs best 
• Sales trends across products and time intervals 
• Recommendations for improving sales performance

4. TASKS 
Task 1: Planning & Architecture (Miro) 
Using Miro or any equivalent whiteboard tool: 
1. Design a Data Flow & Architecture Diagram that outlines: 
• Where the data comes from (source) 
• How it is processed (ETL pipeline) 
• Where it is stored (Snowflake) 
• How it is analyzed and presented 
2. List the Key Insights that the team should deliver, such as: 
• Sales by product category and time intervals 
• High-performing and low-performing products 
• Total revenue calculations 
3. Outline the calculations to be performed: 
•  Total Amount = unit_price * transaction_qty 
• Grouping by 30-minute time intervals 
• Total units sold by product type or detail 
You can add on the above, this is just to give you an idea of what is expected from the Miro 
planning. 
Task 2: Data Processing in Snowflake 
1. Convert the provided Excel data to CSV. 
2. Load the CSV into Snowflake 
3. Perform data transformations: 
• Create a new column: transaction_time_bucket to group transactions into 30
minute intervals (Or it can be 1 hour intervals) 
• Cast unit_price properly (some entries use commas, e.g., '3,1' should be converted 
to 3.1) 
• Compute total_amount = unit_price * transaction_qty 
• Use SQL to group by product types, time buckets, etc. 
You can add on the above, this is just to give you an idea of what is expected from the Data 
Processing. 
Task 3: Data Analysis in Excel  
After processing the data in Snowflake: 
1. Export the processed table to Microsoft Excel or your visualization tool 
2. Create dashboards or pivot tables showing: 
• Total revenue per product type 
• Peak time intervals for sales 
• Quantity of items sold by product category 
• Best-selling product types or details 
• Use charts and graphs to make the story visually appealing
